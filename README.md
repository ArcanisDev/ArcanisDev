🎁 Why Release This?
After years of benefiting from the MapleStory private server community, I decided to give back by open-sourcing ArcanisCMS. This release is my way of helping others after experiencing issues with the Awaken Project. I’ll continue improving it in my free time, and contributions are welcome!

🔧 Known Issues
Some CSS issues on specific pages, affecting image responsiveness.
Vote logs sometimes pop up in front of the AdminCP – will fix this when I have time.
